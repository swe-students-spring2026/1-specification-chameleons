### NYU Students
- Studies on campus multiple times per week
- Studies independently or in groups
- Moves between different buildings depending on their schedule
- Has specific needs for a study location such as temperature and seating conditions

**Goals/Needs**
1. Find study locations that fit specific needs (quiet, temperature, outlets, seating)
2. Avoid crowded or unusable study spaces
3. Compare study spots based on other students' feedback
4. Discover new study locations on campus

**Problems/Frustrations**
1. Popular study locations are often overcrowded, especially during midterms or finals
2. Unaware of alternative or lesser-known study locations during busy or peak hours
3. There’s no centralized platform to see honest, up-to-date reviews of NYU study locations
4. Hard to know if a space is quiet, has outlets, or has comfortable seating until arriving

### NYU Faculty
- Oversee campus facilities
- Responsible for maintenance, space allocation, and improvements
- Interact with students in learning environments

**Goals / Needs**
1. Identify quiet and reliable spaces for academic work for their students
2. Recommend appropriate study locations to students  
3. Stay informed about the quality and availability of study spaces  
4. Use student and faculty feedback to prioritize improvements 

**Problems / Frustrations**
1. Overcrowded or noisy study areas disrupt academic work for their students
2. Limited visibility into student experiences across different study locations  
3. Difficulty identifying which study spaces best support focused work  
4. Challenges in balancing limited resources with high student demand

### Administrators
- Manage and maintain the study location platform  
- Moderate user-generated content and reviews  
- Update study location information and media  

**Goals / Needs**
1. Maintain accurate and up-to-date study location data  
2. Moderate reviews to ensure quality and appropriateness  
3. View analytics on usage, ratings, and engagement  
4. Identify trends or problem areas based on user feedback  

**Problems / Frustrations**
1. Inconsistent or outdated study location information  
2. Limited tools for analyzing user feedback and platform usage  
3. Limited ability to compare trends across different study locations
4. Difficulty sharing updates or changes to study locations with users

## Product Vision Statement

The Product will increase students' knowledge of study spaces around NYU's campus, allowing them to explore more confidently and broaden their experience.
