## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder(s)
NYU Students
- Studies on campus multiple times per week
- Studies independently or in groups
- Moves between different buildings depending on their schedule
- Has specific needs for a study location such as temperature and seating conditions

### Goals/Needs
- Find study locations that fit specific needs (quiet, temperature, outlets, seating)
- Avoid crowded or unusable study spaces
- Compare study spots based on other students' feedback
- Discover new study locations on campus

### Problems/Frustrations
- Popular study locations are often overcrowded, especially during midterms or finals
- Unaware of alternative or lesser-known study locations during busy or peak hours
- There’s no centralized platform to see honest, up-to-date reviews of NYU study locations
- Hard to know if a space is quiet, has outlets, or has comfortable seating until arriving

## Product Vision Statement

The Product will increase students' knowledge of study spaces around NYU's campus, allowing them to explore more confidently and broaden their experience.

## User Requirements
### NYU Students
- As an NYU student, I want to view a map of nearby study spaces so that I can quickly find places close to my current building.
- As an NYU student, I want to filter study locations by noise level, temperature, seating, and outlet availability so that I can find a space that fits my study needs.
- As an NYU student, I want to see how crowded a study space is so that I can avoid wasting time walking to full locations.
- As an NYU student, I want to read recent reviews from other students so that I know what to expect before arriving.
- As an NYU student, I want to leave a review of a study space so that I can share my experience with others.
- As an NYU student, I want to rate study spaces on comfort, noise, and usefulness so that comparisons are easy.
- As an NYU student, I want to discover lesser-known study locations so that I have more options during peak hours.
- As an NYU student, I want to save my favorite study spaces so that I can return to them later.
- As an NYU student, I want to see photos of study locations so that I can visually assess the space.
- As an NYU student, I want to see opening hours and access restrictions so that I don’t arrive when a space is closed.

### Admins

- As an admin, I want to upload or approve photos of study locations so that visuals accurately represent the space.
- As an admin, I want to highlight underutilized study spaces so that campus study traffic is more evenly distributed.
- As an admin, I want to view analytics on study space usage so that I can identify trends and problem areas.
